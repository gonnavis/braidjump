BraidJump
=========

BraidJump is merge of the beautiful art of indie-adventure game Braid*, 
and the concepts of iPhone-platforming game Doodle Jump. 
The goal is simply to get as far as you can jumping on different kinds of platforms, 
while dodging enemies and keeping from falling down.

This was originally made for a Opera's [NTNU HTML5 Challenge](http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/2010/11/11/the-ntnu-html5-challenge) in 2010, and was my first js-game ever!

A big thanks go to David Hellman the creator of the Braid graphics,
and of course Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid. (It's an awesome little game, try it if you haven't.)

* The Braid graphics were given out “for people to use as they like” by the artist at
