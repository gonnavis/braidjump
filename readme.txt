My HTML5 application is called BraidJump, 
and is a merge of the beautiful art of indie-adventure game Braid*, 
and the concepts of iPhone-platforming game Doodle Jump. 
The goal is simply to get as far as you can jumping on different kinds of platforms, 
while dodging enemies and keeping from falling down.

The game displays at least three aspects of HTML5:
- Canvas: The graphics are drawn on an HTML5 canvas.
- Audio**: The HTML5 audio-tag is used for background-music and sounds.
- Local Storage: Highscores are saved in the browser.

BraidJump deserves a chance at winning because it is a cute, 
addicting game showcasing some of the most key aspects of HTML5. 
Furthermore it proves that we don’t need plugins to make cool games in the browser…

A big thanks go to David Hellman the creator of the Braid graphics,
and of course Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid. (It's an awesome little game, try it if you haven't.)
